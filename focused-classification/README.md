### In-focus/out-of-focus classification

Despite auto-focusing systems in modern microscopes, obtained images are still should be filtered out to remove blurred images with artefacts, to find planes of one specimen with different focused areas. In comparison to classical focus measure operators, Deep Learning techniques allow not to lose small focused parts of the image and ignore artifacts in optical system (dust, drops, condensate).
