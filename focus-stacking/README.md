Baselines:  
1) Wavelet transform algorithm - Classic Computer Vision techniques[1].
2) IFCNN: A general image fusion
 framework based on convolutional
 neural network [2] - Deep Learning model

Proposed solution: Deep Learning model:
FusionCGAN: An end-to-end fusion method
for few-focus images using conditional GAN [3].

Metrics: 
qualitative evaluation - 28 people were interviewed;
quantitative evaluation: the Blind/Referenceless Image Spatial QUality Evaluator (BRISQUE) score [4], A pretrained CNN (CNNIQA) score [5].
